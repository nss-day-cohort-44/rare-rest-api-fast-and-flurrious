            "content": "DEARBORN, MI—Saying the time was now to take decisive action on climate change, Ford CEO Jim Farley launched the company’s electric vehicle push Monday by having his buddy stand watch while he stole a battery from a parked Toyota Prius. “Bold plans like this will help ensure that Ford stays at the forefront of climate innovation and delivers on its goal of an electrified fleet by 2035—hey, Rickie, are you keeping an eye out for the cops? Don’t let me catch you playing that electric poker bullshit again,” said the automotive CEO, tinkering under the hood of the 2017 Prius before muttering under his breath that “this goddamn thing is scalding hot” after his knuckle glanced the radiator. “The science is clear: The future of the industry is in renewables. In fact, this battery alone can carry a passenger for up to 100 miles on one charge and goes for about five grand on Craigslist. All right, I seriously just heard sirens. Go! Fucking go!” At press time, Ford had walked back its climate plans indefinitely after the Prius’s owner appeared out of a nearby apartment building with a baseball bat, sending Farley and his friend scattering down the block.",

Huh? Say, you dumb or sum’n, boy? I don’t appreciate you starin’ at me, neither, you stonyeyed sonofabitch.” After it failed to respond to several warning shots, Brookson reportedly noticed the snowman was wearing his 7-year-old daughter’s scarf and immediately fired multiple rounds into the head and chest of the “thievin’ coward.”",

Residents can finally shuffle outside to meet with friends anywhere in our dirty, crumbling facility to watch each other waste away. And every one of our vaccinated residents can start visiting with their families, if their families still bother to visit them. It’s just great to see that dull, glazed look in their eyes again.” At press time, the staff were celebrating the restoring of normalcy after seeing a resident die from something besides coronavirus again.",

And the crazy thing is neither of them even seem to care. Jesus Christ, what are we supposed to do? How long can this madness go on?” At press time, the rest of the staff was white-knuckling it through the meeting after a third employee loudly chimed in to add his thoughts despite the others showing no signs of slowing down.",
